# JavaScript Trading Dashboard

![JavaScript Trading Dashboard](dashboardTrading.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

- Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

- The application is available at *http://localhost:8080* in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example shows the creation of a simple trading dashboard with multiple individual charts on a single pane.

The chart contains:
- Japanese candlesticks ( ***OHLC series*** ) to represent the market price data
- Mountains area ( ***AreaRange series*** ) to represent the difference between high & low values
- Mountains area ( ***Area series*** ) to represent the volume

## Legend

Legend in this example is a UI object embedded to the chart using predefined simple builders for horizontal or vertical layout.

- Horizontal legend

    ```javascript
    // Create a horizontal legend embedded to the chart.
    const legend = chart.addLegendBox( LegendBoxBuilders.HorizontalLegendBox )
    ```
    
- Vertical legend

    ```javascript
    // Create a vertical legend embedded to the chart.
    const legend = chart.addLegendBox( LegendBoxBuilders.VerticalLegendBox )
    ```

The whole chart with contained series, the whole dashboard with contained charts and series, or the series individually can be easily attached to the legend box.

- Adding a chart

    ```javascript
    // Attach the chart and its series to legend.
    // Creates a group with charts.
    const entries = legend.add( chart )
    ```

- Adding a dashboard

    ```javascript
    // Attach the dashboard with charts with series to legend.
    // Creates groups of charts with series.
    const entries = legend.add( dashboard )
    ```

- Adding a series

    ```javascript
    // Attach the individual series as a group to legend.
    // Creates a group from a single series.
    const entries = legend.add( series )
    ```
